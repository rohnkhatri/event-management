Okay, here's a template for a good GitHub README for your Event Management System project.

# College-Level Event Management System - Spring Boot Microservices

This project is a college-level demonstration of an Event Management System built using a Spring Boot microservices architecture. It showcases user authentication, event management, and inter-service communication.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **User Roles:**
    *   **Admin:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on events.
    *   **User:** Can register for multiple events.
*   **JWT-Based Authentication:** Secure login for users and admins.
*   **Microservices Architecture:**
    *   Service Discovery with Eureka Server.
    *   Centralized API Gateway for routing and security.
    *   Dedicated services for User Management and Event Management.
*   **Data Storage:** MySQL used for persistence with separate schemas for authentication and event data.
*   **RESTful APIs:** Well-defined APIs for interaction.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system comprises the following microservices:


[Client (Postman/Angular)] <--> [API Gateway (8080)] <--> [Eureka Server (8761)]
| ^
| | (Discovery)
V |
[User Service (8081)] --- (MySQL: auth_schema)
|
V
[Event Service (8082)] -- (MySQL: event_schema)

[Common Lib Project] (Shared DTOs, Enums - Used by User, Event, API Gateway)

*   **`eureka-server-project`**: Handles service discovery. All other microservices register with Eureka.
*   **`api-gateway-project`**: Single entry point for all client requests. Handles routing, JWT validation, and exposes login/registration APIs via the `user-service`.
*   **`user-service-project`**: Manages user data (ID, username, email, hashed password, role) in the `auth_schema`. Handles user registration and login (JWT generation).
*   **`event-service-project`**: Manages event data (ID, name, description, times, location) and user registrations for events in the `event_schema`.
*   **`common-lib-project`**: A shared library containing DTOs, request/response models, and enums used across services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Backend:**
    *   Java 17+
    *   Spring Boot 3.x
    *   Spring Cloud (Gateway, Netflix Eureka Client/Server)
    *   Spring Security (for JWT handling)
    *   Spring Data JPA
    *   JJWT (Java JWT library)
*   **Database:** MySQL
*   **Build Tool:** Maven
*   **Libraries:** Lombok

## üìã Prerequisites

*   JDK 17 or later
*   Apache Maven 3.6+
*   MySQL Server (running locally)
*   MySQL Client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver)
*   IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse/STS)
*   API Testing Tool (e.g., Postman, Insomnia)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Running

**1. Database Setup:**

   Connect to your MySQL server and create the required schemas:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE auth_schema;
   CREATE DATABASE event_schema;
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Note: Tables will be created automatically by Spring Data JPA (ddl-auto=update).

2. Configure Database Credentials:

Update the application.properties file in user-service-project/src/main/resources/ and event-service-project/src/main/resources/ with your MySQL username and password:

spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Properties
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

3. Configure JWT Secret:

Ensure the jwt.secret property is the same in:

user-service-project/src/main/resources/application.properties

api-gateway-project/src/main/resources/application.properties

jwt.secret=YourVerySecretKeyThatIsLongAndSecureEnoughForHS256 # CHANGE THIS!
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Properties
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

4. Build common-lib-project:

Navigate to the common-lib-project directory and run:

mvn clean install
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This installs the shared library into your local Maven repository.

5. Run the Microservices:

Start the services in the following order. You can run them from your IDE or using Maven:

# In a new terminal, navigate to project directory and run:
# Example for eureka-server-project:
# cd eureka-server-project
# mvn spring-boot:run
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

eureka-server-project (Port: 8761)

user-service-project (Port: 8081)

event-service-project (Port: 8082)

api-gateway-project (Port: 8080)

6. Verify Eureka Registration:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8761. You should see USER-SERVICE, EVENT-SERVICE, and API-GATEWAY registered under "Instances currently registered with Eureka".

üöÄ API Endpoints

All requests go through the API Gateway (http://localhost:8080).

Authentication (/api/auth)

Register User:

POST /api/auth/register

Body: RegistrationRequest JSON (username, email, password)

Access: Public

Login User:

POST /api/auth/login

Body: LoginRequest JSON (username, password)

Access: Public

Response: AuthResponse JSON (token, username, role)

Events (/api/events)

(Requires Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN> header for all endpoints below, except where noted as public by gateway config)

Create Event (Admin):

POST /api/events

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>

Body: EventDto JSON

Access: Admin

Get All Events:

GET /api/events

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <ANY_VALID_TOKEN>

Access: Authenticated Users

Get Event by ID:

GET /api/events/{eventId}

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <ANY_VALID_TOKEN>

Access: Authenticated Users

Update Event (Admin):

PUT /api/events/{eventId}

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>

Body: EventDto JSON

Access: Admin

Delete Event (Admin):

DELETE /api/events/{eventId}

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>

Access: Admin

Register for Event (User):

POST /api/events/{eventId}/register

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <USER_TOKEN> (Gateway adds X-User-Id, X-Username)

Access: Authenticated Users

Get My Registered Events (User):

GET /api/events/my-registrations

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <USER_TOKEN> (Gateway adds X-User-Id)

Access: Authenticated Users

üîê Key Security Aspects

JWT Generation: user-service generates JWTs upon successful login.

JWT Validation: api-gateway validates JWTs for all protected routes using JwtAuthenticationFilter.

Role-Based Authorization: api-gateway (GatewayConfig.java) enforces role-based access (e.g., only ADMINs can POST/PUT/DELETE events) by checking headers (X-User-Role) added by the JWT filter.

Statelessness: JWTs enable stateless authentication, suitable for microservices.

üìÅ Project Structure

Each microservice (eureka-server-project, api-gateway-project, user-service-project, event-service-project) and the shared library (common-lib-project) are separate Spring Boot/Maven projects.

üí° Future Enhancements (Suggestions)

Integrate an Angular frontend.

Implement more fine-grained exception handling (@ControllerAdvice).

Add pagination and filtering for event lists.

Use Flyway or Liquibase for database schema migrations.

Implement resilience patterns (e.g., Resilience4j Circuit Breaker).

Centralized logging and monitoring.
